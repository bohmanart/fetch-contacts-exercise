# Fetch Contacts Exercise

This exercise uses `fetch()` to get a paginatated list of contacts from an API.
It is then rendered with a component architecture using React and stateless components.
Makes use of `ReactDOM.createPortal` to render a modal of selected contacts outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
